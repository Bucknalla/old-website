title: MicroPython & ESP32
---

This post is a slight deviation from the weekly blog posts that relate to my research; today we're taking a look at MicroPython (MP), a port of CPython 3.5 optimised and minimised for embedded hardware. We'll be taking a look at what MicroPython is, an example MCU that is currently supported by it and how you can do about writing your own custom MP firmware.

## What is MicroPython?


## What is the ESP32?


## Compiling Your Own MicroPython Firmware


## Write Your First MicroPython Library in C


## Useful MicroPython Resources
